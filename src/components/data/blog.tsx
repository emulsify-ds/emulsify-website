      Consequently, the role of “site builder” has shifted in new directions as
      well. The days of a lone digital gatekeeper at every organization are
      quickly fading—and thank goodness for that. Given the scale of digital
      demands your business faces, your developers can no longer be the
      bottleneck where projects stall before launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past several years, development platforms have grown more
      accommodating to those with less technical backgrounds. Custom modules
      have opened up new possibilities for developing no-code websites that can
      be updated and enhanced quickly and securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Drupal 8 and 9 feature user-friendly capabilities that enable content
      owners to update a website’s architecture without complex code. As these
      interfaces grow more streamlined, your organization’s power users are
      ready to take on additional responsibilities. As a result, IT managers
      need to be flexible while still ensuring your website stays healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change always introduces a level of discomfort. However, to ensure your
      organization stays competitive, you have to embrace the shifts that will
      make your digital projects run more smoothly.
    </p>
    <h2>Minimize Development Delays by Empowering Content Owners</h2>
    <p>
      As tech leaders, many of you have worn the title of webmaster at some
      point during your career. Shouldering the responsibility for your entire
      company’s online presence, a webmaster’s responsibilities encompass site
      design and development as well as digital marketing and communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life somehow felt easier—or at least more stable—when only one person
      could make changes to a website. Now, businesses recognize websites are
      more than novelties and provide a sophisticated means to reach customers.
      In the process, your stakeholders have grown more technically literate and
      willing to contribute to your website.
    </p>

      However, enabling other teams to access your website produces a level of
      anxiety for website managers. All developers carry a long-held instinct to
      lock down configuration to prevent critical errors. Unfortunately, your
      fear of losing control over your code will bog down your organization’s
      content delivery capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content management systems like Drupal have made life easier for
      developers. The addition of{' '}
      <a href="http://www.google.com">component libraries</a> has enabled
      development projects to proceed faster and more efficiently. But as
      appetites for digital projects have grown, your content owners always seem
      to need more access to your site’s controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t let fear to hold back your site’s development. Though Drupal,
      you can{' '}
      <a href="http://www.google.com">provide a flexible backend experience</a>.
      Freeing users to modify page layouts, manage menus, and build dynamic
      content in <a href="http://www.google.com">Views</a> and{' '}
      <a href="http://www.google.com">Webforms</a>. As the platform has
      advanced, site-building has grown more accessible through “codeless”
      development within the Drupal UI.

    <h2>
      No-Code Software Plays a Critical Role in Modern Website Development
    </h2>
    <p>
      Developers live for creating the right custom tool for a given job. As a
      result, we have a love-hate relationship with the shift toward no-code
      development platform software. On one hand, it streamlines production, but
      on the other it reduces development to simply checking boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next generation of web apps and APIs have matured toward user-friendly
      interfaces, and some developers have grown worried they’re more likely to
      be replaced. The fact is, these changes have encouraged citizen developers
      to grow in numbers. Website managers must also grow with the ongoing shift
      toward codeless development or risk being left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A developer’s role isn’t being eliminated as much as it’s shifting to
      other parts of the development stack. For example, Drupal has systems in
      place for managing form fields, but their capabilities are limited.
      Depending on what your organization needs, you can use field formatter
      plugins to change its results to different currencies or apply new
      calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one with a strong coding background wants to be the person clicking
      buttons to reconfigure a website. Instead, you want your developers to
      write the custom plugins and organize backend code in a way that empowers
      someone else to click those buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, your organization needs someone with a technical mindset to provide
      effective governance and training for your content owners. No-code
      solutions through a module like Views will not necessarily make good
      decisions in every instance. By applying the right processes, you can
      empower people and give them a greater sense of ownership over your
      organization’s website.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Managers Must Balance Expanding Access with Effective Website Governance
    </h2>
    <p>
      Given the right workflow, your content owners should be able to update
      fields, menus, and other configurations without producing anxiety in your
      IT department. Allowing these tasks to remain so difficult they’re only
      understood by specialists is not a security policy. You can’t serve your
      organization’s needs by ensuring every user must go through a single
      person to publish changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, permitting content owners to contribute to site development does
      not mean opening the floodgates. Good governance is essential to both
      maximizing the capabilities of a modern site platform and retaining a
      consistent website experience. Establishing a training program will ensure
      your users know the capabilities of each website module and how to deploy
      them properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After users have completed training, you can expand their roles and
      permission levels within the CMS to make changes within restricted areas.
      You should also create a feature request process that allows new projects
      to be reviewed by your developers and internal stakeholders. Feature
      requests provide a transparent roadmap of your organization’s development
      plans. Then, once approved, the project undergoes a formal change review
      to verify it’s been properly built before being published.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most robust option for maintaining the health of your website’s code
      is to create a staging environment where all changes are first published.
      Once your team tests new features on the staging site, the changes can
      then be moved to production.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supported by effective training and workflow management, no-code
      tools for website management speed development and eliminate production
      bottlenecks. IT teams acting as the single source for development
      expertise may have offered more security, but that model has is now
      unsustainable. With a thoughtful approach to opening your development
      process, you can ensure your organization’s needs remain fulfilled.
