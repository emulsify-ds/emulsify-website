Emulsify Starter is a scaffolding repository for the Emulsify CLI. It creates a platform-agnostic build that is meant for a standalone installation. It provides Emulsify Core integration for development, available configuration file overrides, and the various `npm run ...` commands to develop/test/build your project.

## Installation

`emulsify init [project_name] --platform none .`

### Requirements

1. [Node v20 (we recommend NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. [Emulsify CLI](/docs/supporting-projects/emulsify-cli) (required if you want to install components from an external library. Not required if you are creating components from scratch.)
