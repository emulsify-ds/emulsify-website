Emulsify Drupal Starter is a scaffolding repository for the Emulsify CLI. It creates a subtheme outside of a Drupal installation that is [identical to the subtheme](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-drupal/tree/main/whisk) generated by Emulsify when using drush from within a Drupal installation. 

When integrating this starter into a Drupal installation the [Emulsify base theme](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-drupal) and [Emulsify Tools](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify_tools/) module will be required.

## Installation

`emulsify init [project_name] --platform drupal .`

### Requirements

1. [Node v20 (we recommend NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. [Emulsify CLI](/docs/supporting-projects/emulsify-cli) (required if you want to install components from an external library. Not required if you are creating components from scratch.)
