# Storybook FAQ

### When I build Storybook, it begins copying files and directories outside of my project. What gives?

Ensure that there are no spaces in your `build-storybook` command after the `-s` flag within `package.json`.

### Example
Do: `"build-storybook": "build-storybook -s ./dist,./images -o .out"`
Don't: `"build-storybook": "build-storybook -s ./dist, ./images -o .out"`
